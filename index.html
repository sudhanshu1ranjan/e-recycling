			<div class="b">What is e-waste?</div>
			<div class="c">The term e-waste is loosely applied to electronic equipment when it’s reached the end of its useful life, but there is no clear definition of what e-waste is. While we most commonly associate computers, fax machines, cell phones, and charging cables with e-waste, it could also apply to appliances. <br><br>

However, there’s no definition for e-waste so whether or not appliances are technically e-waste is yet to be determined. I’m very interested to see how the definition of e-waste develops as we advance with technology or IoT (Internet of things).</div>
<div class="e">Are you sure it’s e-waste?</div>
<div class="c">Raise your hand if you have a stash of old cellphones sitting in a drawer? I’m embarrassed to say I actually have every phone I’ve ever owned. All of them are sitting in a drawer together - chillin.
	<br><br>
	<b>Even if you think your old devices are broken or suffering from water damage, they still have value and can probably be repaired.</b><br><br>
	You can trade in your old devices with SellCell. In fact, they are so confident that the user will get the best price for their old devices that they offer a Best Price Guarantee.

So, one of the easiest ways to part with your electronics (and avoid e-waste!) is getting a little bit of money in your pocket.

Before you even get to recycling, double check to see if you can sell your device back first.
</div>
<div class="e">don’t landfill!</div>
<div class="c">If your devices weren’t good enough to sell, remember: e-waste should NEVER be put in the landfill. <br><br>

E-waste contains toxic and hazardous materials like mercury, lead, cadmium, beryllium, chromium and chemical flame retardants which are particularly dangerous when leached into our soil and water.


</div>
<div class="e">e-waste is full of valuable resources:</div>
<div class="c">E-waste also contains valuable precious metals like gold, copper, and silver and rare earth minerals. We're depleting the earth very quickly of non-renewable rare-earth minerals used to make electronics. So it’s important for the future of the industry to figure out how we can recycle and reuse what we have.<br><br>

One of my favorite e-waste recycling initiatives is this jewellery line. Dell has partnered with Bayou with Love to make upcycled jewellery with the metals from e-waste. Which I think is pretty awesome.
